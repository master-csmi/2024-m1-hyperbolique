# Adaptive Implicit Schemes for Hyperbolic Equations

This project focuses on studying adaptive theta schemes for equations such as the linear transport equation.

SATh_utilities.py contains all the methods.
plotting.ipynb is a notebook where a study of the basic Theta Scheme was done.
To load a simulation, modify the parameters as you wish in the args.json file, and run simulation.py
(only the basic Theta Scheme is available yet)
